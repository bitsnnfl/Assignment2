    "Make a restaurant recommendation engine for Zomato using user review data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](zomato-banner.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prologue\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been lucky and after graduation got employed as a Data Engineer at Zomato. You have been living in Mumbai, spending your big fat check, but due to the recent emergence of Swiggy, Zomato is now facing a major competitor in the market. Your boss Dr Mukherjee, given the situation, has assigned you to improve the recommendation engine employed at Zomato. It is now upon you to keep your stocks floating and grab that year-end bonus.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been two days since you were assigned the project, you researched about recommender systems, for which you found [this blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/brief-on-recommender-systems-b86a1068a4dd) extremely helpful. After reading the blog, you decided to make a **collaborative filtering based recommendation system using autoencoders**, since Zomato was already using content-based filtering which wasn't giving promising results. You decided to use user review data on restaurants situated in Mumbai since it has a high user engagement. Following are the notes, you made while researching:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- In this assignment, we will be working on implementing a recommendation system on Zomato's user reviews data for different restaurants. We will be using a technique called Collaborative Filtering which is one of the most popular ways of implementing a recommendation system and we will be training an autoencoder. Don't be afraid if you have never heard these terms before we will be explaining them in detail. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have ratings of 5 users on 4 different restaurants and a user might not have rated a particular restaurant. We can create arrange the ratings in a user-restaurant matrix from the data, that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the users have not rated all the restaurants. In collaborative filtering we try to find these missing values and based on these values we make a recommendation to them. In this figure, for example, Kabir has rated ANC and Looters but not Food King, however Suvigya has rated all three of these restaurants. We can observe that the ratings of Suvigya on ANC and Looters match a lot with Kabir and we can to some extent say that Kabir's rating for Food King will be close to 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Youtube Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zKuYvjFFS8 (till 5:36)\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoencoder is a neural network which learns to copy its input to its output. The network can be viewed as consisting 2 parts, an encoder which downsamples the input to a compact representation and a decoder which produces a reconstruction of the input. Autoencoders falls under the area of unsupervised learning algorithms, since for training an autoencoder we only need raw data without any label. An autoencoder with one hidden layer is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](autoencoder.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that we can have as many layers as we want in our autoencoder. The only thing to keep in mind is to reduce the dimensionality of the input in the encoder part of the network and increase the dimensionality of the hidden representation to the size of actual input in decoder network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have defined the architecture of our autoencoder, we can train it using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Feed the batch of inputs *x* to the network and obtain the predictions *p*\n",
    "2.   Compute the loss between the reconstructed inputs *p* and the actual inputs *x* i.e. *L(p,x)*\n",
    "3. Compute the gradients of this loss with respect to the parameters of the model using backprop.\n",
    "4. Use these gradients to take optimization step, for e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 1-4 till convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaborative Filtering using Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see how to use autoencoders for collaborative filtering. Lets first see the steps involved in training an autoencoder for this problem and then we will develope an intuition on why it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](autoencoder2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure we are feeding Kabir's ratings to the autoencoder. Note that the ratings corresponding to the missing values are kept zero. After computing the predictions of autoencoder we compute mean squared error between the input ratings and the ratings predicting by the network. One important thing to note here is that while computing the loss we do not consider the predictions corresponding to 0 ratings i.e. the missing values and only compute the error for the ratings that we are given. This is because we do not want our network to learn that the output corresponding to the missing values is zero but instead learn a reasonable value. We repeat the same thing for other users and then backprogate the gradients and take optimization steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "During test time we will feed the input with the missing ratings to the network and use the output of the network to determine the ratings of the missing values. Once we have the ratings for those missing values we can make a recommendation accordingly.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we start building our model, we first need to get our data in a suitable form which can be fed to the network. The input to the network will be a vector of size 5138 (number of restaurants) for each user, where each element of the vector will contain the rating of the restaurant whose id matches with the index of that element. If the user has not rated a particular restaurant, the element corresponding to that will be set to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: If a user has only rated the restaurants with ids 3, 19 and 1009 as 2, 4 and 3.5 respectively, then the feature vector for that user will be a 5138 sized array containing 2 in the index 3, 4 in the index 19, 3.5 in index 1009 and zero everywhere else.\n",

    "Hence our full dataset will be a matrix of size 3579 X 5138 (number of users X number of restaurants).\n",

    "Since we know that the users have reviewed only a small portion of all 5138 restaurants, the data matrix will be very sparse (will mostly contain zeros). Hence it does not make sense to store the whole 3579 X 5138 matrix in memory. Instead, we create a sparse matrix where for each user we store the tuples containing the restaurant id and the rating for that restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: In the previous example where we had a user who rated restaurants 3, 19 and 1009 only, we will store the tuples [(3, 2), (19, 4), (1009, 3.5)]. Earlier we store an array of size 5138 elements for the user but now we need to have an array containing 3 elements, saving much memory. While feeding the inputs to the neural net we convert this sparse representation to the full 5138-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `get_sparse_mat` takes as the input the filename string which can either be `train.dat` and `test.dat` and constructs a sparse matrix containing the list of tuples for each user as we described above.

However, there are many changes that we can make in our architecture and learning algorithm to improve its performance. For example:\n",

From our model predictions we will obtain the ratings corresponding to these restaurants and store them in file `predictions.csv` in the format `prediction` for corresponding `userId, restaurantID` in a predefined sequence. You are then required to upload this CSV file on the kaggle competition created for this assignment along with this notebook.\n",
